# mean_bmi_2014_2016

In an effort to reduce obesity rates worldwide (and the correlated health issues), this research project analyzes data on the mean body mass index (BMI) of several populations across the world. This research project references data provided by the World Health Organization on the mean BMI of populations around the globe. This data is analyzed using quantitative research methods and the tools SAS and Tableau. The results of this research project address the question, how has mean BMI changed for specific countries in recent years, specifically countries that have decreased ultra-processed food/drink consumption. The analysis shows there has been an increase in mean BMI for North American and Australian populations from 2014-2016 despite a decrease in ultra-processed food and drink sales (in these select countries). However, it is identified that there is a need for further research before a strong conclusion can be made regarding the correlation between mean BMI and ultra-processed food and drink consumption.
